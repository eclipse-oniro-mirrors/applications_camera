 * An *action creator* is, quite simply, a function that creates an action. Do
 * not confuse the two termsâ€”again, an action is a payload of information, and
 * an action creator is a factory that creates an action.
 *
 * Calling an action creator only produces an action, but does not dispatch
 * it. You need to call the store's `dispatch` function to actually cause the
 * mutation. Sometimes we say *bound action creators* to mean functions that
 * call an action creator and immediately dispatch its result to a specific
 * store instance.
 *
 * If an action creator needs to read the current state, perform an API call,
 * or cause a side effect, like a routing transition, it should return an
 * async action instead of an action.
